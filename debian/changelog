pyfll (2009.03) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * NOT RELEASED YET

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * make lxde buildable again.
  * remove dash from the package list, it's virtually essential. Likewise 
    there's no need to set it explicitly as /bin/sh anymore.
  * remove insserv from the package list, it's virtually essential.
  * fix grub.cfg for grub2 ElTorito no-emulation boot.
  * fix timeout definition for grub2.

  * add "splix" to hwsupport-printscan, it's needed for SPL/ SPL-2 (Samsung)
    printers.
  * disable k3b and kdebluetooth again, their kde4 versions are not in a 
    releaseable state yet.
  * s/icedtea-gcjwebplugin/icedtea6-plugin/
  * remove geany from lxde builds, a full blown IDE isn't necessary.
  * remove xfce4-icon-theme, it doesn't exist anymore.
  * remove fuse-utils depending packages, fuse-utils' triggers fail to succeed
    in chroot.

    virtualbox-ose kernel modules anymore.
  * add skanlite to larger kde flavours.
  * temporarily add libgnome2-0 to abiword instances to workaround a bug in
    apt's recursive dependency resolver.

      not sure if it needs more, or is handled via python-fll lang/pkg detection

  [ devil ]
  * added krosspython, parley needs it for its plugins

pyfll (2009.02) aether; urgency=low

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * disable totally broken hplip.

    to cope with amd64 guests, in case hardware virtualisation is available.
  * hpilp should be installable again.
  * remove tvtime and kdetv, there are no analogue senders in germany or the 
    US anymore.
  * #517884 is fixed in Debian, remove the locale generation workaround again.
  * remove get-kde4-pinning.sh, debian-qt-kde has switched to git and KDE4 is 
    on the doorstep to sid anyways.
  * dump kde4 preferences for apt, kde4 is in sid now, rendering this obsolete.

  * include konversation again, 1.2~alpha1-1 has reached unstable.

      removed as soon as debconf preseeding works again.

  * xserver: comment all packages providing xserver-xorg-video-4 making xorg

    inline with kde-lite

  [ Kel Modderman ]

    GetCache() noise.
  * Use md5sum() and sha256sum() utilities of the apt_pkg module instead
    of extra subprocesses.
  * Run a dist-upgrade in each build chroot after priming apt so that

    module.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * move hplip-gui to kde-desktop - it pulls in 88MB qt libs, tx ModestUser

  * update hwsupport-printscan for cupsys -> cups transition
   From 1.3.7-6 changelog:
