pyfll (1.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Add minimal ./debian/* infrastructure to source tree for archival and
    copyright purposes.
  * Adapt fll.py to python2.5, which has try, except, finally blocks.
  * Word wrap de/fll.8.txt to sane 80 character per line.
  * Use partition string method of python2.5 to determine pathnames inside of
    a build chroot.
  * Update README file to indicate current minimum requirements.
  * No longer explicitly rebuild the initramfs for installed kernels.
  * Write /etc/default/distro configuration file before installation of
    package so that the live initramfs may be preseeded correctly.
  * Support trivial repositories when repo config section contains the
    'trivial' keyword set to any value at all.
  * Add insserv.postinst to activate startpar concurrency when insserv is
    used.
  * Add wacom-tools to xserver package module.
  * Drop update-menus from xserver.postinst, dpkg-trigger now takes care of
    it.
  * Update fll_init_whitelist for cupsys -> cups rename.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * kcalc (desktop calulator) should be a core kde utility, moved to kde-basic
  * xfce needs a desktop calculator, add gcalctool  
  * set erebos default wallpaper in fll.conf template 
  * add/replace gtk-qt-engine and kde-style-domino to appropriate pkg lists  
  * revert accidental commit of my temp pkg changes 
  * remove wmauda (dock remote control for audacious) to keep audacious out of
    xfce - audacious has a new (hours old) bug where it segfaults on start
      - aqualung is left as the default music player
  * partial revert 18631 - domino -> qtcurve
  * update hwsupport-printscan for cupsys -> cups transition
   From 1.3.7-6 changelog:
   "Rename the package to cups. This is the proper upstream name. Upstream has
    made it clear that the usual distro patches are not a trademark
    violation." -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>
  * still waiting on cups(ys)-driver-gutenprint package to get updated

    - screenkast (Closes: #482978).
  * add skeleton for sanity.postinst to give the installed package lists some
    sanity checks against misbehaving packages.
  * remove openchrome again, doesn't work without further userspace and kernel
    DRM changes.
  * add ttf-liberation.
  * don't squash /etc/blkid.tab.
