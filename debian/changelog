    version number.
  * Add screen to initscript whitelist.
  * Add support for grub2 as live media bootloader.
  * More cupsys -> cups package name changes (cups-driver-gutenprint).

    build process.
  * Add info to command line utility line-up.

    use ttf-dejavu now.

  * Drop ttf-liberation per default, it seem to render poorly in
    mozilla.
  * Add feh so that fluxbox can set a background.

    what mechanism should be used for starting the bluetooth services,
    udev-config-sidux seems to also provide one.
  * Add bluez-utils and bluez-pcmcia-support to hwsupport-extra package
    module.
  * Whitelist bluz-utils initscripts again.

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * add xfce4-session to recommends handling, primarily to pull in dbus-x11

  * add netbase to automatic recommends handling, we need to keep ifupdown - 
    hard dependency or not.
  * icedtea-gcjwebplugin has finally hit main.
  * drop lilo, it's implicitly conflicting with grub and about to be dropped 
    post-lenny.
  * remove FileType preconfiguration from vimrc.local, it's erroring out.
  * add zenity to XFCE.
  * add utils-x to xfce-lite.

    through startsyslog indirectly.
  * add kvm support and the userspace tools to kde-full.
  * disable kvm for the time being.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * move hplip-gui to kde-desktop - it pulls in 88MB qt libs, tx ModestUser
  * patch to allow for an apt_preferences fll.conf var for custom apt-pinning
   - this is useful for kde4 testing, and is ignored if commented
  * add commented debian-experimental repo section as example for kde4 testing
  * add contrib dir including valid apt preferences file for kde4 testing

  [ Joaquim Boura ]
  * splited xfce into xfce and xfce-lite.
  * use xarchiver instead of thunar-archive-plugin as this needs ark or 
    file-roller.

  [ Ferdinand Thommes ]
  * add foo2zjs for HP Printers

  * Add insserv.postinst to activate startpar concurrency when insserv is
    used.

      - aqualung is left as the default music player
  * partial revert 18631 - domino -> qtcurve
  * update hwsupport-printscan for cupsys -> cups transition
   From 1.3.7-6 changelog:
