pyfll (2008.03) ourea; urgency=low

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Modify past and current changelog entries to use date release code for
    version number.
  * Add screen to initscript whitelist.
  * Add support for grub2 as live media bootloader.
  * More cupsys -> cups package name changes (cups-driver-gutenprint).
  * Use a common timestamp for iso name and /etc/distro-version of all chroots
    contained on iso. The timestamp is taken from moment of invocation of
    build process.
  * Add info to command line utility line-up.
  * Add FLL_DISTRO_URL to distro-defaults section of default build config.
  * Add aspell and i18n entry. It is used by various desktop apps
    (eg. xchat, kmail).
  * Put en_AU in i18n list.
  * Drop ttf-bitstream-vera from xserver package module, our desktop settings
    use ttf-dejavu now.
  * Add autoindent option to vimrc.local configuration created by
    cli.postinst.
  * When disabling bitmap font, use a relative symlink rather than an
    absolute one.
  * ttf-liberation should encompass all of what ttf-freefont provided,
    therefore remove ttf-freefont as it is no longer required.
  * Uncomment xserver-xorg-video-openchrome and give it some exposure.
  * Drop ttf-liberation per default, it seem to render poorly in
    mozilla.
  * Add feh so that fluxbox can set a background.
  * Remove bluez-utils from data/fll_init_whitelist, it is not clear
    what mechanism should be used for starting the bluetooth services,
    udev-config-sidux seems to also provide one.
  * Add bluez-utils and bluez-pcmcia-support to hwsupport-extra package
    module.
  * Whitelist bluz-utils initscripts again.

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * add xfce4-session to recommends handling, primarily to pull in dbus-x11
    for XFCE builds.
  * add kopete to recommends handling to support SSL connections.
  * remove xchat-systray from xfce, as both provide systray icons, thanks to
    towo.
  * add default user to vboxusers.
  * replace ktorrent by ktorrent2.2 for kde-desktop (kde3).
  * add openjdk-6.
  * adapt example config to not use "sidux" as distro name.
  * generate kde4 pinning automatically from Debian's source package svn.
  * add kde-l10n to apt-pinning.
  * tweak pinning whitelist.
  * switch pinning whitelist to blacklist.
  * fix anchor package for kde(4)-l10n.
  * add fll-live-initscripts to automatic recommends handling, required for
    liveapt.
  * give gtk-qt-engine the boot from the dvd profile, it's broken.
  * add netbase to automatic recommends handling, we need to keep ifupdown - 
    hard dependency or not.
  * icedtea-gcjwebplugin has finally hit main.
  * drop lilo, it's implicitly conflicting with grub and about to be dropped 
    post-lenny.
  * remove FileType preconfiguration from vimrc.local, it's erroring out.
  * add zenity to XFCE.
  * add utils-x to xfce-lite.
  * depend pm syslog d√¶mon (rsyslog) directly, instead of pulling it in 
    through startsyslog indirectly.
  * add kvm support and the userspace tools to kde-full.
  * disable kvm for the time being.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * move hplip-gui to kde-desktop - it pulls in 88MB qt libs, tx ModestUser
  * patch to allow for an apt_preferences fll.conf var for custom apt-pinning
   - this is useful for kde4 testing, and is ignored if commented
  * add commented debian-experimental repo section as example for kde4 testing
  * add contrib dir including valid apt preferences file for kde4 testing
  * add kde4-lite and associated package profile for kde4 testing
  * update apt-pin preferences to handle kde4 full metapackage
  * add kde4-full and associated package lists
  * adjust default fll.conf to use ourea wallpaper
  * replace non-existent sidux-art-gnome with sidux-art-xfce for distr-xfce 

  [ Niall Walsh ]
  * use ['packages']['lang'] to generate a list of packages required
    per lang and an on-cd debian package repo with them for liveapt.
  * dvb-utils replaced by dvb-apps
  * add on-cd repo packages to the manifest (binary and source)
  * add packagesearch to builds with qt4
  * do not try to find i18n packages for the country part of a locale
  * do try and find i18n packages for the non-hyphenated locale (e.g. ptbr)

  [ Joaquim Boura ]
  * splited xfce into xfce and xfce-lite.
  * use xarchiver instead of thunar-archive-plugin as this needs ark or 
    file-roller.

  [ Ferdinand Thommes ]
  * add foo2zjs for HP Printers

    copyright purposes.
  * Adapt fll.py to python2.5, which has try, except, finally blocks.
  * Word wrap de/fll.8.txt to sane 80 character per line.
  * Use partition string method of python2.5 to determine pathnames inside of
    a build chroot.
  * Update README file to indicate current minimum requirements.
  * No longer explicitly rebuild the initramfs for installed kernels.
  * Write /etc/default/distro configuration file before installation of
    package so that the live initramfs may be preseeded correctly.
  * Support trivial repositories when repo config section contains the
    'trivial' keyword set to any value at all.
  * Add insserv.postinst to activate startpar concurrency when insserv is
    used.
  * Add wacom-tools to xserver package module.
  * Drop update-menus from xserver.postinst, dpkg-trigger now takes care of
    it.
  * Update fll_init_whitelist for cupsys -> cups rename.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * kcalc (desktop calulator) should be a core kde utility, moved to kde-basic

  * add/replace gtk-qt-engine and kde-style-domino to appropriate pkg lists  
  * revert accidental commit of my temp pkg changes 
  * remove wmauda (dock remote control for audacious) to keep audacious out of
    xfce - audacious has a new (hours old) bug where it segfaults on start
      - aqualung is left as the default music player
  * partial revert 18631 - domino -> qtcurve
  * update hwsupport-printscan for cupsys -> cups transition
   From 1.3.7-6 changelog:
   "Rename the package to cups. This is the proper upstream name. Upstream has
