pyfll (1.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Add minimal ./debian/* infrastructure to source tree for archival and
    copyright purposes.
  * Adapt fll.py to python2.5, which has try, except, finally blocks.
  * No longer explictly rebuild the live initramfs, dpkg-triggers cause the
    initramfs to be updated at the end of installation.
  * Word wrap de/fll.8.txt to sane 80 character per line.
