* change default kernel package name in pyfll to match fll.conf format
* test cdebootstrap
* support booting multiple images
* work out apt_cdrom stuff so it works as original? currently creating .disk/info on the cd root fixes the casper problem
* get package profiles other than ubuntu-desktop working
