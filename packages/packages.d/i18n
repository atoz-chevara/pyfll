# This is a special package profile module, it contains mappings for
# packages that have locale support in the form of extra packages.
#
# List the package name as the key, and each value should be the string
# of locale support package name without the locale specific substring as
# suffix. List standard locale codes (eg. en_AU, de_DE) in the 'i18n'
# subsection of the 'packages' section in the build configuration.
